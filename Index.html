<p class="mb-6  ml-6 mr-6 text-2xl text-justify text-gray-900 first-letter:text-6xl first-letter:font-bold first-letter:text-gray-900  first-letter:mr-3 first-letter:float-left">Governor Das says it as it is. </p>
<p class="mb-6   ml-6 mr-6  text-2xl text-gray-900"> In a recent engagement, the Governor said all the good things about the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (2016). But he also exhorted banks and financial creditors to explore alternative channels if there is better hope of a quicker and more fruitful resolution.</p>
<p class="mb-6   ml-6 mr-6  text-2xl text-gray-900"> Speaking at the Centre for Advanced Financial Research and Learning’s (CAFRAL) <a href="https://rbidocs.rbi.org.in/rdocs/Speeches/PDFs/ADDRESSBYGOVERNORCAFRALIBC0E26AB4786BE46CCBE95515563021E2F.PDF" class="font-2xl text-blue-600 underline "> conference on Future Road Map of Resolution of Stressed Assets and Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) </a>  Governor Das forcefully stressed that :</p>

<blockquote class="text-xl text-justify italic pl-12 ml-20 mr-20 mb-6  font-semibold text-black text-justify"> “There appears to be a trend in recent years towards balancing the rights of Operational Creditors (OCs) with those of Financial Creditors (FCs) under the Code…It has to be recognised that the financial creditors take the maximum risk and hence their risk needs to be commensurately compensated and with priority. Accordingly, <strong>any amendments to the Code and its evolution thereof may continue to lay emphasis on a financial creditor-led resolution framework, in an overarching manner. </strong>” (emphasis added)</blockquote>

<p class="mb-6   ml-6 mr-6  text-2xl text-gray-900">One is left with a feeling that the Governor agrees the IBC needs to be fixed, but, being a career bureaucrat, he knows what not to say. Instead, he has suggested ways to navigate the larger systemic problem of stressed assets. To my mind, there are three sub-texts in the Governor’s statement.</p>
<p class="mb-6   ml-6 mr-6  text-2xl text-gray-900">One, Governor Das has taken a public stand on the Rainbow Papers case (2022). In my recollection, this is the most authoritative reaction to the Supreme Court judgment (judgement here). The Hon'ble Court had ordered that the State is a secured creditor under the Gujarat Value Added Tax 2003 (GVAT). The Court held that the debts owed to the State under the GVAT Act. are to rank equally with other secured debts. A subsequent challenge to the judgement in a bunch of five review petitions was dismissed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court (Judgement <a href="https://main.sci.gov.in/supremecourt/2022/32268/32268_2022_6_1501_48032_Judgement_31-Oct-2023.pdf"> here </a> on October 31, 2023. To be sure, the Hon'ble Court did not dismiss the review petitions on merits of the arguments, but on the scope of the review petitions.</p>

<p class="mb-6   ml-6 mr-6  text-2xl text-gray-900"> The Rainbow Papers ruling is the current law of the land. Read a quick recap <a href="https://pradeepraje.substack.com/p/when-the-judicial-conscience-is-not"> here</a>. Governor Das has taken a stand that “financial creditors take the maximum risk and hence their risk needs to be commensurately compensated and with priority.” This, of course, was the position in the landmark Swiss Ribbons case (<a href=" https://main.sci.gov.in/supremecourt/2018/4653/4653_2018_Judgement_25-Jan-2019.pdf" class="font-2xl text-blue-600 underline "> here</a> [Para. 28])

<p class="mb-6   ml-6 mr-6  text-2xl text-gray-900"> Two, the Governor’s stance suggests he doesn’t expect a radical change in the working or the throughput of the IBC, such being the nature of a judicial process.  Data would entirely corroborate the Governor’s stand. The World Bank Doing Business Report (discontinued after 2020) reports the mean time for insolvency resolution in India at 1.6 years. That is, almost 19-20 months. This compares with a mean of 2,3 years in South Asia. One harbours the impression that the legislation was too ambitious in its target timelines of six months (180 days), with the proviso of a one-time extension of 90 days (3 months).</p>


<p class="mb-6   ml-6 mr-6  text-2xl text-gray-900"> Latest <a href="https://ibbi.gov.in/uploads/publication/b4ce3516920836e9ff9b1e816137bf97.pdf" class="font-2xl text-blue-600 underline "> data </a>for the  period ending March 2023  from the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (IBBI) documents the average time from admission of insolvency proceedings to approval of a resolution plan by the adjudicating authority at 612 days (1.67 years) , and to an order of liquidation at 456 days (1.25 years). The governor notes “certain serious concerns” here: As of September 2023, 67% of the ongoing CIRP cases have already crossed the total timeline of 270 days including possible extension period of 90 days. [Para 15, <i>ibid.</i>]


<bodyp class="mb-6   ml-6 mr-6  text-2xl text-gray-900">Which brings us to the third thread of this speech: on exploring alternative options and the pre-pack platform. It is worth citing the Governor’s statement verbatim because—to my mind-- it is pregnant with intent on the way forward.
The Governor notes: “there has been an institutional attempt towards adopting the prepack schemes which is essentially a debtor-in-possession model. Globally, pre-packs have evolved organically without statutory interventions, because in those countries, the insolvency regimes had stabilized. In such predictable scenarios, the judiciary’s role is rather limited because the Courts generally approve the resolution plans after verifying compliance with the laid down tenets.”</p>

<p class="mb-6   ml-6 mr-6  text-2xl text-gray-900">It may be easy to conclude a subtle disappointment with the legal process. The alternative viewpoint in the Governor’s statement is an endorsement of the Debtor-in-Possession framework, operationalised in the IBC (Amendment) Act, 2021, for the MSME sector as the Pre-Packaged Insolvency Resolution Process (PPIRP). </p>
<p class="mb-6   ml-6 mr-6  text-2xl text-gray-900">Beginning with an unambiguous foundation that the initiation of insolvency proceedings rapidly erodes value in the debtor. The debtor firm is paralysed, neck down.  Financial creditors refuse additional finances, trade partners and operational creditors impose stricter terms of trade and generally the cash flow is decimated. Buyers migrate to stronger competitors. The loss of suppliers, employees, lenders and other stakeholders reduces the firm’s ability to generate revenues, ultimately destroying going-concern value and making potentially viable firms become non-viable businesses. The objective of modern insolvency laws, globally, is therefore to impose time limitations to that some value may be salvaged 
In contrast to the Creditor-in-possession (CIP) model above, several jurisdictions around the world—principally the USA, UK, Canada and Australia-- have adopted the debtor-in-possession (‘DIP’) model which allows the debtor to attempt salvage without disturbing the management framework and with the active support of its lenders. The academically inclined may read a survey <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40804-023-00289-z#ref-CR51" class="font-2xl text-blue-600 underline "> here</a>. </p>
<p class="mb-6   ml-6 mr-6  text-2xl text-gray-900">In return, the laws provide lenders with superior priority that typically range from a basic administrative expense priority to the possibility of becoming a junior or, in some jurisdictions, even a senior secured creditor. The most headlined example of this model is the Chapter 11 proceedings in the USA, aka "reorganization" bankruptcy. The debtor remains “in possession, “but as a trustee of all stakeholders with a fiduciary duty to protect value in the business. The debtor proposes a plan of reorganization. creditors whose rights are affected may vote on the plan. If the gets the required percentage of votes and satisfies certain legal requirements, the court may sanction the plan. <a href=" https://www.uscourts.gov/services-forms/bankruptcy/bankruptcy-basics/chapter-11-bankruptcy-basics" class="font-2xl text-blue-600 underline "> Quick reference here</a></p>

<p class="mb-6   ml-6 mr-6  text-2xl text-gray-900"><p class="mb-6   ml-6 mr-6  text-2xl text-gray-900">Of course, if Chapter 11 proceedings do not work out as expected, the distressed firm transitions to Chapter 7 (liquidation proceedings). <a href= "https://www.justice.gov/ust/bankruptcy-fact-sheets/overview-bankruptcy-chapters#:~:text=Chapter%207%20bankruptcy%20is%20a,proceeds%20are%20distributed%20to%20creditors" class="font-2xl text-blue-600 underline "> Quick refernce here</a>. </p>.
<p class="mb-6   ml-6 mr-6  text-2xl text-gray-900">Long story short: the law provides for debtor to remain in possession and attempt a full salvage or fresh restart, in the Debtor-in-possession model. Creditors who support the firm in this phase are adequately compensated with superiority in claims.</p>
<p class="mb-6   ml-6 mr-6  text-2xl text-gray-900">In contrast, the control of the debtor firm moves to the creditors (specifically to a Committee of Creditors (CoC)) as soon as the insolvency proceedings are admitted. One may usefully visualise this situation as a critically ill patient on life support with a “Do not resuscitate” sticker on the forehead.</p>
<p class="mb-6   ml-6 mr-6  text-2xl text-gray-900">Perhaps, the cognoscenti will take note of the Governor’s opinion. The IBC framework started with a lot of promise, but it is structurally weak. It needs to be restored ground up. Seven years is a reasonable amount of time to wave the hallucinations. That is the Governor’s opinion. Not mine.</p>
